Removed org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.security.AllAccessPermission since it never worked and is not a valid jaas concept
Migration:
replace by java.security.AllPermission

Extracted DataModel with entities and attributes out of AbstractComposerField and moved to org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.data.model
Migration: None, sometimes organize imports is necessary.
Legacy: There is legacy support with deprecated AbstractComposerAttribute and AbstractComposerEntity. Also inner attributes and entities of a composer field are still valid
and wrapped in a ComposerFieldDataModel.
Renaming:
AbstractComposerAttribute -> AbstractDataModelAttribute
AbstractComposerEntity -> AbstractDataModelEntity
ComposerAttributeInjector -> DataModelAttributeInjector
ComposerOp -> DataModelAttributeOp
ComposerConstants -> DataModelConstants
ComposerUtility -> DataModelUtility
IComposerAttribute -> IDataModelAttribute
IComposerOp -> IDataModelAttributeOp
IComposerEntity -> IDataModelEntity
