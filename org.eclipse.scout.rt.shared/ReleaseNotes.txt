Removed org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.security.AllAccessPermission since it never worked and is not a valid jaas concept
Migration:
replace by java.security.AllPermission

Extracted DataModel with entities and attributes out of AbstractComposerField and moved to org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.data.model
Migration: None, sometimes organize imports is necessary.
Legacy: There is legacy support with deprecated AbstractComposerAttribute and AbstractComposerEntity. Also inner attributes and entities of a composer field are still valid
and wrapped in a ComposerFieldDataModel.
Renaming:
AbstractComposerAttribute -> AbstractDataModelAttribute
AbstractComposerEntity -> AbstractDataModelEntity
ComposerAttributeInjector -> DataModelAttributeInjector
ComposerOp -> DataModelAttributeOp
ComposerConstants -> DataModelConstants
ComposerUtility -> DataModelUtility
IComposerAttribute -> IDataModelAttribute
IComposerOp -> IDataModelAttributeOp
IComposerEntity -> IDataModelEntity

added support for safe and lenient permissions transfer via service tunnel overriding serialization of Permissions object to list of serialized objects thus supporting skipping unknown permissions instead of skipping the whole Permissions class
see ServiceTunnelInputStream, ServiceTunnelOutputStream, LenientPermissionWrapper, LenientPermissionsWrapper

Internal security audit
- server stack traces must not be sent to client
- server log must contain all exceptions (except intended business logic exceptions)
- enhanced access control on gui remote service calls: see enahncements on IAccessControlService.checkServiceTunnelAccess
- adding logout service and calling it from IClientSession.stop();
Migration: None
