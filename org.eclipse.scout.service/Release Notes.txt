bsi ticket 102381: ServiceUse of osgi is re-used unless unget service is called.
This is bad for ad-hoc proxy services that must be created every time when needed (especially on multiple parall threads)
Fixed by adding service ref lock in SERVICES helper.

Bugzilla 383083: Added a new extension point to allow customized service initialization

By default, a service of type org.eclipse.scout.service.AbstractService is initialized with properties in the config.ini file.
If the scout application is running inside another RCP application, the config.ini file often cannot be accessed.

Therefore,a new extension point serviceInitializerFactory has been added to org.eclipse.scout.service.services to allow the registration of a
custom service initializer factory.
The default service initialization behavior stays the same.
