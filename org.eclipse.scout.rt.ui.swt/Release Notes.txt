In our project we had the problem, that from two different Applications two KeyStrokeManager where instanciated. The KeyStrokeManager were not
aware of the SwtEnvironment where they were instatiatetd from. This resulted that key-strokes where "used" two times.
Problem: If one would close a SmartfieldProposal with an esc-keystroke, the whole form would close.
Solution: The KeyStrokeManager is aware of the SwtEnvironment where it was instaciated and gives the environment to the filters.
old:
      getEnvironment().addKeyStrokeFilter(textField, new ISwtKeyStrokeFilter(){
        @Override
        public boolean accept(Event e){
          return doSomething();
        }
      });
new:
      getEnvironment().addKeyStrokeFilter(textField, new ISwtKeyStrokeFilter(){
        @Override
        public boolean accept(Event e, ISwtEnvironment environment){
          if(getEnvironment().equals(environment)){
            return doSomething();
          }
          return false;
        }
      });
