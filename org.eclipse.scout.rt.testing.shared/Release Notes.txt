Bug 350389: improve Scout RT testing support
o added support for specifying bundle and classes inclusion and exclusion filters, respectively
  bundleNameIncludeFilter
  bundleNameExcludeFilter
  classNameIncludeFilter
  classNameExcludeFilter
  All four properties support wildcard expressions (supports * and ?) as well as regular expressions. The latter must start with 'regex:'.
o added property failOnError: exit code > 0 if true and a failure or error occurred. Exit code is always 0 if false.
o added property haltOnFailure: test execution stops on first failure or error if set to true. Otherwise all tests are executed.
Migration:
Now failOnError and haltOnFailure both default to false. Was true before.
