/**
 * Helper class to schedule jobs that optionally run on behalf of a {@link RunContext}. This class is for convenience
 * purpose to facilitate the creation and scheduling of jobs.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Jobs.schedule(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *     // do something
 *   }
 * }, Jobs.newInput()
 *     .withRunContext(RunContexts.copyCurrent()
 *         .withSubject(...)
 *         .withLocale(Locale.US))
 *     .withSchedulingDelay(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
 *     .withName("job example"));
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code snippet illustrates how the job is finally run:
 *
 * <pre>
 * BEANS.get(IJobManager.class).schedule(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *     runContext.run(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *       &#064;Override
 *       public void run() throws Exception {
 *         // do some work
 *       }
 *     });
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
