Ticket 95'946
Visual markup for editable cells
Migration: None

27.01.2011 dwi
Problem:
In SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer, evaluation of cell's editable state to draw respective marker icon caused loops and UI freeze.
So far, the only way to determine cell's editable state was to call AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow). This required synchronization with model thread which affected performance badly. Even worse, if model thread was busy, the enqueued request did not succeed at all (timeout).
Solution:
- Property added to hold result of AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow) which can be evaluated in UI thread without need of model thread synchronization.
- Population of property: Property is populated when AbstractColumn#decorateCellInternal is called.
- Change of ICellSpecialization and implementing classes: added ICellSpecialization$isEditable(), added ICellSpecialization#setEditable(boolean)
- Change of ICell and implementing classes: added ICell#isEditable()) -> default value is false
- Change of Cell: added Cell#isEditable(), added Cell#setEditableInternal(boolean). Accessor setEditableInternal(boolean) is internal by intention as not intended for public use as various checks in AbstractColumn#execIsEditable are bypassed otherwise (JavaDoc added). E.g., do not use in execDecorateCell.
- Change of SwingTableModel#isCellEditable() --> synchronization with model thread not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)
- Change of SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer() --> synchronization with model thread for querying editable state not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)

bsi ticket 99212
added support for the config.ini/eclipse.ini property "app.zone" in AbstractSwingEnvironment.decorateAppZone(Window w).
app.zone=prod | production (paints no special border around all dialogs and frames, this is the default)
app.zone=int | integration (paints a yellow border around all dialogs and frames)
app.zone=test (paints an orange border around all dialogs and frames)
app.zone=dev | development (paints a red border around all dialogs and frames)

- ColorUtility: Added a method to "multiply" two colors (instead of merging them). See JavaDoc for details.
- ColorUtility: All methods are now null-safe.
- SwingScoutTable: Fixed calculation of resulting foreground and background color when a row is selected (merge -> multiply).

Moved the methods in org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing.ext.LookAndFeelUtility provided under LGPL to org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing.laf.rayo.painters.RayoLookAndFeelUtility:
public static Color darker(Color color, double ratio);
public static Color lighter(Color color, double ratio);
public static Color blend(Color color1, Color color2);
public static Color blend(Color color1, Color color2, double ratio);

Migration:
If you use any of the above methods, use the RayoLookAndFeelUtility or the original source: http://geosoft.no/software/colorutil/ColorUtil.java.html

bsi ticket 102027
RayoLookAndFeelUtility removed again and added lighter/darker to org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing.basic.ColorUtility to avoid duplicate code (suggested by bsh).
public static Color lighter(Color color, float ratio);
public static Color darker(Color color, float ratio)

Migration:
If you use any of the deleted methods in LookAndFeelUtility, use the ColorUtility or the original source: http://geosoft.no/software/colorutil/ColorUtil.java.html
