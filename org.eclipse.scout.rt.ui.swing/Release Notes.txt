Visual markup for editable cells

Problem:
In SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer, evaluation of cell's editable state to draw respective marker icon caused loops and UI freeze.
So far, the only way to determine cell's editable state was to call AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow). This required synchronization with model thread which affected performance badly. Even worse, if model thread was busy, the enqueued request did not succeed at all (timeout).
Solution:
- Property added to hold result of AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow) which can be evaluated in UI thread without need of model thread synchronization.
- Population of property: Property is populated when AbstractColumn#decorateCellInternal is called.
- Change of ICellSpecialization and implementing classes: added ICellSpecialization$isEditable(), added ICellSpecialization#setEditable(boolean)
- Change of ICell and implementing classes: added ICell#isEditable()) -> default value is false
- Change of Cell: added Cell#isEditable(), added Cell#setEditableInternal(boolean). Accessor setEditableInternal(boolean) is internal by intention as not intended for public use as various checks in AbstractColumn#execIsEditable are bypassed otherwise (JavaDoc added). E.g., do not use in execDecorateCell.
- Change of SwingTableModel#isCellEditable() --> synchronization with model thread not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)
- Change of SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer() --> synchronization with model thread for querying editable state not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)

- ColorUtility: Added a method to "multiply" two colors (instead of merging them). See JavaDoc for details.
- ColorUtility: All methods are now null-safe.
- SwingScoutTable: Fixed calculation of resulting foreground and background color when a row is selected (merge -> multiply).
