bsi ticket 102089, bug 355669
Problem:
When a listbox or treebox is checkable=true then it shows checkmarks as icons.
However if the listbox also has an icon defined either directly on the listbox
or via its data provider (codetype/lookupcall), then this icon is not shown.
Solution:
In this (rare) case both icons are displayed as a composite icon.
Migration:
None

BSI ticket #105'026
Problem:
Default font specific issues in HTML cleanup which is applied to the HTML text prior being provided to AbstractHtmlField:
 - Application specific default font settings should always be applied to body style definition if not specified yet
 - default font size unit on SWT should be pt instead of px
 - precedence of font-families should be supported in default font settings
Solution:
- Changed HTMLUtility#cleanupHtml(..) to ensure default font settings to be contained in CSS style definition
- changed default font size unit in AbstractSwtEnvironment#createDefaultFontSettings(Control) to pt
Plug-Ins changed:
- org.eclipse.scout.commons
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swt
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.rap
Migration:
None

Problem:
The Flag enabledAsReadOnly was introduced ca. two years ago. The "true" case is
today standard, also in all other ui reprecentations. As the naming is not
realy clear the idea came up, to remove this flag alltogether. All internal
projects are ok with this.
Solution:
Removed extension point element “enableBehaviour”.
Plug-Ins changed: org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.rap
Migration: Remove extension point “enableBehaviour” in projects rap-bundle.
